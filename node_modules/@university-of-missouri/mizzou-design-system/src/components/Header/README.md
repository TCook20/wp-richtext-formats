# Headers

> A **Header** component is a complex combination of many, site-level components. Often it includes [site navigation](/components/detail/miz-primary-navigation.html), a [masthead](/components/detail/miz-masthead.html) and our Mizzou [Ribbon](/components/detail/miz-ribbons.html).

In the future, many more versions and variants will be produced. These will cater to different theming and departmental needs.

    "items": [
      {
        "link": {
          "text": "Home",
          "href": "#"
        }
      }, {
        "link": {
          "text": "About",

## Options reference

### Options

There are a few contextual variables available in the head.twig file.

| Variable        | Default | Values | Description                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------|---------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `headerOptions` | `{}`    | Object | A simple option that allows you to pass the options objects associated with the three blocks below to set options for those components. |

Note: If you extend `headers.twig` instead of including it, you can do as the example above shows. Simply set the values you need to set, naming each one according to their name: `ribbon`, `masthead` or `navigation`.

### Blocks

Each of these blocks can be used to extend and add more content _or_ override it completely. But be careful, that could cause unintended consquences.

| Block name   | Description                                                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `header`     | Initial block for placing all content within the header container. |
| `ribbon`     | Containing block for the Ribbon.                                   |
| `masthead`   | Containing block for the site Masthead.                            |
| `navigation` | Containing block for the site Navigation.                          |
