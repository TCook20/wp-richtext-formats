## Content
**Kicker** _(optional)_ (max. approximately 40 characters)
	* A kicker, sometimes referred to as an overline, is a smaller, often more abstract heading that “kicks off” a section. 
		* _Example:_ “Show Me Results” or “Strength in Numbers”
	* The kicker should be shorter than the title below it.

**Title** (max. approximately 50 characters)
	* 	The title is a heading that clearly describes the main topic of the component. 
	* Avoid vague titles.  
		* _Example:_ Instead of “Show Me Mizzou” (vague) try “Meet Our Students” or “Success Stories” (more specific).
		
**Source name** (max. approximately 45 characters)
	* Includes the source’s name and sometimes additional information such as title or academic program. 
	
**Source additional info** (max. approximately 55 characters)
	* This is a second line of text below the quote source’s name. It could contain the source’s degree, hometown, title, academic program or other information.

**Quote** (max. approximately 320 characters)
	* Be sure to get approval from the person you are quoting before publishing their quote. 

**Action** (button) (optional) (max. 1) 
	* Button text should start with an action verb and clearly describe where users will go when they tap the button. Avoid using vague actions like “read more” or “learn more.” 
		* _Example:_ Instead of “Learn more” try “Meet Jared Faulk” or “Meet our students.”
	
**Source photo** 
	* _Minimum dimensions:_ 700 pixels wide by 700 pixels tall (1:1 aspect ratio or square)
	* This image will display in a circular frame with the corners of the image removed. For best results, select photos where the subject is in the center of the photo rather than off-center. 
	* Include an alt text description for the photo.
	
## How to use
* Usually used on front and landing pages to highlight student, alumni, employee and supporter quotes or testimonials. 
* Change the featured quote/testimonial on a regular basis. 
* Representation is important. When possible highlight a range of supporters from various backgrounds. 

## Things to avoid
* Avoid using this component more than one time on a single page.
