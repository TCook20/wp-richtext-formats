## Content
**Title** (max. 32 characters) 
	* The title is a heading that clearly describes the main topic of the component. 
	* Avoid vague titles.  
		* _Example:_ Instead of “Show Me Mizzou” (vague) try “Visit Mizzou” (more specific).

**Description** (max. 400 characters) 
	* A description, lead-in or teaser that explains what the user will find when they follow the call to action.  
	* Avoid multiple paragraphs. 
	* Avoid including lists, images, videos or other content. 

**Action** (max. 2 buttons) 
	* Start with an action verb.
	* Make sure the button text clearly describes the action users will be taking when they tap the button. Avoid using vague actions like “read more” or “learn more.” 
		* _Example:_  Instead of “Learn more” try “Start your application”.
	* Keep your action text short, descriptive and personalized to your user’s needs. Consider why someone would want to complete this action when writing your button text. 

## Variations
* Light
* Dark
* Photo background

## How to use
* Use this component on front and landing pages when you need to highlight important actions users should take (Apply, Visit, Register, etc.).
* If using multiple times on a single page, consider using different variations to add visual interest. 

## Things to avoid
* Don’t use this component to present content in its entirety (example: fill with multiple paragraphs, lists, images or video.). It should always link to full content on a separate page. 
* Don’t use this component to highlight content that is not associated with a strong call to action. Use Split Layout instead.
