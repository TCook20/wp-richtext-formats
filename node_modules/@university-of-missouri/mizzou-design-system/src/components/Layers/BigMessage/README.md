## Content
**Title** (max. 32 characters) 
	* Your title heading should clearly describe the content and action.
	* Avoid vague titles.  
		* _Example:_ Instead of “Show Me Mizzou” (vague) try “Visit Mizzou” (more specific).

**Message** (max. 550 characters) 
	* A short, single paragraph message 
	* Avoid multiple paragraphs. 
	* Avoid including lists, images, videos or other content. 

**Action** (max. 2 buttons)
	* Start with an action verb.
	* Make sure the button text clearly describes the action users will be taking when they tap the button. Avoid using vague actions like “read more” or “learn more.” 
		* _Example:_  Instead of “Learn more” try “Start your application”.
	* Keep your action text short, descriptive and personalized to your user’s needs. Consider why someone would want to complete this action when writing your button text. 

## How to use
* Use this component on front and landing pages when you need to highlight an important message with one to two actions (Apply, Visit, Register, etc.)

## Things to avoid
* Don’t use this component to present large amounts of content (e.g., fill with multiple paragraphs, lists, images or video.). It should always link to full content on a separate page.
