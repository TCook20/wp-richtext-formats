## Content
**Section Title** (max. 50 characters)
	* A heading that describes and contextualizes the link list. 
	* Avoid simply referring to these links as “Resources.” This term is generally too vague to be useful. 
		* _Example:_ Instead of “Resources” (vague) use “Academic Programs” or even “Student Organizations” (more specific). 
	
**Links** (min. 3 links, max. 9 links)
	* Make sure the link text clearly describes the content it links to.
	* Front load link text so that most information-carrying words come first
		* _Example:_  Instead of “Office of the University Registrar” try “Registrar” or “University Registrar”.
	* Keep your link text short. 

## How to use
* Use this component on front and landing pages when you need to highlight links to related content. 
* Organize links from left to right alphabetically or most to least important. 

## Things to avoid
* Avoid using this component more than once on a single page. 
* Avoid referring to these links as only resources. Try to provide a more specific description of them that indicates how or why someone would use them.
