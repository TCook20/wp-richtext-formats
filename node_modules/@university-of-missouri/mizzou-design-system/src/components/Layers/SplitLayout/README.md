## Content
**Kicker** _(optional)_ (max. approximately 28 characters)
	* A kicker, sometimes referred to as an overline, is a smaller, often more abstract heading that “kicks off” a section. 
		* Example: “Show Me Results” or “Live Like a Tiger”

**Title** (max. approximately 18 characters)
	* Your title heading should clearly describe the content and action.
	* Avoid vague titles.  
		* _Example:_ Instead of “Show Me Mizzou” (vague) try “Visit Mizzou” (more specific).

**Description** (max. approximately 180 characters) 
	* The description is a short lead-in or teaser that explains what the user will find when they follow the call to action. The most successful descriptions describe how this content will help meet a user need, not how this will benefit your department.  
	* Avoid using multiple paragraphs. 

**Action** (max. 1 button) 
	* Button text should start with an action verb and clearly describe where users will go when they tap the button. Avoid using vague actions like “read more” or “learn more.” 
		* _Example:_ Instead of “Learn more” try “Start your application.”
		
**Image** 
	* _Minimum dimensions:_ 688px wide by 459 pixels tall (3:2 aspect ratio)
	* Select images that provide context and help reinforce the adjacent text. 
	* Avoid purely decorative images. 
	* Include an alt text description for the photo.
	
## Variations
* Left text/right photo
* Right text/left photo
* With background image
* No offset

## How to use
* Usually used on front and landing pages when you need to create a highly visible entry point to important or frequently needed content on another page.
* If using multiple times on a single page, alternate style variations. 

## Things to avoid
* Avoid using this component to present content in its entirety (e.g., fill with multiple paragraphs). It should always link to full content on a separate page. 
* Avoid using this component when an appropriate (non-decorative) image cannot be associated with the content. Use Call to Action instead.
