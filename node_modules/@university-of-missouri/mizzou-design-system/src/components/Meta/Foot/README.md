### Options

Contextual variables available in the Foot component.

| Variable                           | Default | Values | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------|---------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `baseURL` OR `Site.ParentThemeURL` | `null`  | String | If you need to provide a pathway to the files of the Design System in your implementation you can provide those values here. **NO** trailing slash. The `Site` object is from MizzouMVC. |

### Blocks

Blocks can be used to extend and add more content _or_ override it completely. But be careful, that could cause unintended consquences.

| Block name   | Description                                                                                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `foot_block` | Currently the only block available in the Foot. JavaScript that is not critical is often loaded here. |
