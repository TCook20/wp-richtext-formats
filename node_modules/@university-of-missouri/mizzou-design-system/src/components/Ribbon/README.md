# Ribbons

>The Mizzou **Ribbon** is an easy and branded way of showing our users they are on an official University of Missouri website. It supports an area for the University signature, if necessary, and a content area where links and a site search field can be placed.

The Ribbon can be called in three ways, outlined below.

- [Include](#simple-include)
- [Include with options](#include-with-options)
- [Extend or Embed](#extends-embed)

## Template reference

### Simple Include

The easiest way to add the Ribbon is to simply include it. You'll get the [default Ribbon](/components/detail/miz-ribbons--base.html).

```twig
{% include '@miz/components/ribbons/ribbons.twig' %}
```

### Include With Options

The standard `class` and `attributes` options are available to add if you need to extend the Ribbon.

**Note:** The `only` option is important if you don't want your options bleeding into other included twig views.

| Param        | Default      | Values | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------|--------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `class`      | `miz-ribbon` | String | Additional classes appended to the ribbon                                                                                                                                       |
| `attributes` | `null`       | Object | Attributes to be applied to the ribbon                                                                                                                                          |
| `link-list`  | `null`       | Object | To add a list of inline links with the Ribbon, add a `link-list` object that contains the same options as the [**Link List**](/components/detail/miz-link-lists.html) component |

```twig
{% set options = {
  "class": 'my-class',
  "attributes": {
    "id": "myRibbon"
  }
} %}

{% include '@miz/components/ribbons/ribbons.twig' with options only %}
```

### Extends/Embed

**Advanced:** There are three blocks available to use if you choose to `extend` or `embed` the file.

| Block             | Default                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `ribbon`          | Missouri signature and site search input |
| `ribbon__sig`     | Missouri signature                       |
| `ribbon__content` | Site search input                        |

**Embed**

```twig
{% embed '@miz/components/ribbons/ribbons.twig'%}

  {% block ribbon__content %}
    {# This is where you will place your content #}

    {# This will give us the search input #}
    \{{ parent() }}

  {% endblock ribbon__content %}
{% endembed %}
```

**Extends**

```twig
{% extends '@miz/components/ribbons/ribbons.twig'%}

{% block ribbon__content %}
  {# This is where you will place your content #}

  {# This will give us the search input #}
  \{{ parent() }}

{% endblock ribbon__content %}
```
