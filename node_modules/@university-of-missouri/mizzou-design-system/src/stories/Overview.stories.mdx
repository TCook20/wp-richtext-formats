The Mizzou Design System is a system of guidelines, patterns and components built for our universityâ€™s specific needs. Its purpose is to help create a consistent user experience across all websites.

The Mizzou Design System provides HTML/Twig, CSS and documentation.
Produced by the [Mizzou Digital Service](https://digitalservice.missouri.edu/) team, this framework is designed to help the MU web developer community create a consistent user experience across all campus websites.

Component Statuses:

- Ready: This component is stable and is ready for general use.
- Prototype: This component is still in development and could change. The component remains in this status until it can be tested further. Wherever possible, we will try to keep the core functionality the same going forward and will communicate any potential breaking changes before updating the System.
- WIP (Work in Progress): This component is in active development and **will** change.
