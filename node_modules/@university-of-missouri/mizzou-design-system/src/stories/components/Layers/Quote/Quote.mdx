## Content

**Kicker** _(optional)_ (max. approximately 40 characters)

- A kicker, sometimes referred to as an overline, is a smaller, often more abstract heading that &ldquo;kicks off&rdquo; a section.
  - _Example:_ &ldquo;Show Me Results&rdquo; or &ldquo;Strength in Numbers&rdquo;
- The kicker should be shorter than the title below it.

**Title** (max. approximately 50 characters)

- The title is a heading that clearly describes the main topic of the component.
- Avoid vague titles.
  - _Example:_ Instead of &ldquo;Show Me Mizzou&rdquo; (vague) try &ldquo;Meet Our Students&rdquo; or &ldquo;Success Stories&rdquo; (more specific).

**Source name** (max. approximately 45 characters)

- Includes the source&rsquo;s name and sometimes additional information such as title or academic program.

**Source additional info** (max. approximately 55 characters)

- This is a second line of text below the quote source&rsquo;s name. It could contain the source&rsquo;s degree, hometown, title, academic program or other information.

**Quote** (max. approximately 320 characters)

- Be sure to get approval from the person you are quoting before publishing their quote.

**Action** (button) (optional) (max. 1)

- Button text should start with an action verb and clearly describe where users will go when they tap the button. Avoid using vague actions like &ldquo;read more&rdquo; or &ldquo;learn more.&rdquo;
  - _Example:_ Instead of &ldquo;Learn more&rdquo; try &ldquo;Meet Jared Faulk&rdquo; or &ldquo;Meet our students.&rdquo;

**Source photo**

- _Minimum dimensions:_ 700 pixels wide by 700 pixels tall (1:1 aspect ratio or square)
- This image will display in a circular frame with the corners of the image removed. For best results, select photos where the subject is in the center of the photo rather than off-center.
- Include an alt text description for the photo.

## How to use

- Usually used on front and landing pages to highlight student, alumni, employee and supporter quotes or testimonials.
- Change the featured quote/testimonial on a regular basis.
- Representation is important. When possible highlight a range of supporters from various backgrounds.

## Things to avoid

- Avoid using this component more than one time on a single page.
