## Content

**Title** (max. 32 characters)

- The title is a heading that clearly describes the main topic of the component.
- Avoid vague titles.
  - _Example:_ Instead of “Show Me Mizzou” (vague) try “Visit Mizzou” (more specific).

**Description** (max. 400 characters)

- A description, lead-in or teaser that explains what the user will find when they follow the call to action.
- Avoid multiple paragraphs.
- Avoid including lists, images, videos or other content.

**Action** (max. 2 buttons)

- Start with an action verb.
- Make sure the button text clearly describes the action users will be taking when they tap the button. Avoid using vague actions like &ldquo;read more&rdquo; or &ldquo;learn more.&rdquo;
  - _Example:_ Instead of &ldquo;Learn more&rdquo; try &ldquo;Start your application&rdquo;.
- Keep your action text short, descriptive and personalized to your user&rsquo;s needs. Consider why someone would want to complete this action when writing your button text.

## Variations

- Light
- Dark
- Photo background

## How to use

- Use this component on front and landing pages when you need to highlight important actions users should take (Apply, Visit, Register, etc.).
- If using multiple times on a single page, consider using different variations to add visual interest.

## Things to avoid

- Don&rsquo;t use this component to present content in its entirety (example: fill with multiple paragraphs, lists, images or video.). It should always link to full content on a separate page.
- Don&rsquo;t use this component to highlight content that is not associated with a strong call to action. Use Split Layout instead.
