**Kicker** _(optional)_ (max. approximately 40 characters)

- A kicker, sometimes referred to as an overline, is a smaller, often more abstract heading that “kicks off” a section.
  - _Example:_ “Show Me Results” or “Strength in Numbers”
- The kicker should be shorter than the title below it.

**Title** (max. approximately 50 characters)

- The title is a heading that clearly describes the main topic of the component.
- Avoid vague titles.
  - _Example:_ Instead of “Show Me Mizzou” (vague) try “Facts & Figures” (more specific).

- Bold number or percentage that appears in a gold box.
- Examples:
  - 31,103
  - $168M
  - 48%

- Descriptive text about the number. Examples:
  - Students from all 50 states and 100 countries

## How to use

- Usually used on front and landing pages to showcase number-based facts that would be meaningful to site visitors.

## Things to avoid

- Avoid using this component more than one time on a single page.
- Avoid listing facts that might be impressive to small internal audiences but not of interest to the majority of your site visitors.
- Double check your facts to make sure they are accurately stated. [Institutional Research and Quality Improvement](https://irqi.missouri.edu/) can help.
