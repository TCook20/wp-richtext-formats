## Content

**Kicker** _(optional)_ (max. approximately 28 characters)

- A kicker, sometimes referred to as an overline, is a smaller, often more abstract heading that &ldquo;kicks off&rdquo; a section.
  - Example: &ldquo;Show Me Results&rdquo; or &ldquo;Live Like a Tiger&rdquo;

**Title** (max. approximately 18 characters)

- Your title heading should clearly describe the content and action.
- Avoid vague titles.
  - _Example:_ Instead of &ldquo;Show Me Mizzou&rdquo; (vague) try &ldquo;Visit Mizzou&rdquo; (more specific).

**Description** (max. approximately 180 characters)

- The description is a short lead-in or teaser that explains what the user will find when they follow the call to action. The most successful descriptions describe how this content will help meet a user need, not how this will benefit your department.
- Avoid using multiple paragraphs.

**Action** (max. 1 button)

- Button text should start with an action verb and clearly describe where users will go when they tap the button. Avoid using vague actions like &ldquo;read more&rdquo; or &ldquo;learn more.&rdquo;
  - _Example:_ Instead of &ldquo;Learn more&rdquo; try &ldquo;Start your application.&rdquo;

**Image**

- _Minimum dimensions:_ 688px wide by 459 pixels tall (3:2 aspect ratio)
- Select images that provide context and help reinforce the adjacent text.
- Avoid purely decorative images.
- Include an alt text description for the photo.

## Variations

- Left text/right photo
- Right text/left photo
- With background image
- No offset

## How to use

- Usually used on front and landing pages when you need to create a highly visible entry point to important or frequently needed content on another page.
- If using multiple times on a single page, alternate style variations.

## Things to avoid

- Avoid using this component to present content in its entirety (e.g., fill with multiple paragraphs). It should always link to full content on a separate page.
- Avoid using this component when an appropriate (non-decorative) image cannot be associated with the content. Use Call to Action instead.
