## Support philosophy

When building campus sites, you are encouraged to follow **progressive enhancement**.

**Note:** _Progressive enhancement_ is a principle that emphasizes designing sites where core web content and functionality is accessible in all supported browsers. Progressive enhancement allows all users access to the content and functionality of a website using any (supported) browser or Internet connection, while also providing an enhanced version of the site to those using an advanced browser or greater bandwidth.
