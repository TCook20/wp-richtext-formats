<Title />

Because the Mizzou Design System uses Bootstrap for a foundation, [theming](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/theming/) is available from the ground up.

While much of our own theme settings are still in development, if you need to use any Bootstrap classes that support theme variants they are available to you. Please be aware, though, the Bootstrap defaults will be overridden by our values.

## Theme settings

We override [Bootstrapâ€™s theming](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/theming/#theme-colors) with our own values.

## Theme examples

**Mizzou buttons**

_Currently we only support the following theme buttons with our core `.miz-button`. More will become available in a future release._

<Canvas>
  <Button primary={true}>Primary</Button>
  <Button secondary={true}>Secondary</Button>
</Canvas>

### Dark &amp; light views

We are planning on adding dark and light settings in the future. By using a single class we will be able to change a component from a light version to a dark one.
