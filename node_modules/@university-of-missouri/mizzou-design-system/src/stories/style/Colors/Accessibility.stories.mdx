Use of MU gold (`#F1B82D`) and its variations with text should be carefully considered. MU gold paired with white backgrounds or white text on MU gold backgrounds violates accessibility standards specified in Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) [2.0 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum AA](https://web.archive.org/web/20160404062608/https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html).

This quick guide contains alternative color choices you can use to ensure accessibility while following the Mizzou branding standards.

## Not Accessible

White text is not accessible with a gold background:
<Canvas>
  <div className="miz-fill--gold miz-space--inset-sm"><p className="miz-text--white">White text on a gold background is <strong>not</strong> accessible.</p><p>Black text on gold <strong>is</strong> accessible.</p></div>
</Canvas>

The reverse is also true: gold text is not accessible with a white (or light) background:
<Canvas>
  <div className="miz-fill--black-100 miz-space--inset-sm"><p className="miz-text--gold">Gold text on a white background is <strong>not</strong> accessible.</p><p>This text <strong>is</strong> accessible.</p></div>
</Canvas>

## How can you use more Gold in your designs?

You can use any variation of MU gold in rules, borders, backgrounds, behind black text, and as text on black backgrounds, in fact, our primary button style is gold.

<Canvas>
  <AnchorButton
    link={ `#` }
    primary={ true }
  >
    I'm accessible!
  </AnchorButton>
</Canvas>

The only gold variation that passes any color contrast standards is `#AF7C00`. It passes the color contrast test on large text (14 point and **bold** or larger, or 18 point or larger).

Unfortunately, this particular color looks brown or coppery and isn’t very appealing as text. It’s best for borders and shadows on other gold objects. **Do not use it for text.** It’s best to stick with dark grays or an accent variation that does pass.
