## Getting started

The framework can be used in two ways:

- Fully compiled CSS, JavaScript, icons, fonts found in the [`builds` branch](https://gitlab.com/university-of-missouri/mizzou-digital/miz-ds/mizzou-design-system/tree/builds).
- Source files available to extend for your own site builds. _Ask us about this if you're interested!_

### Compiled builds

There are is a `builds` branch available that contains both production and source files. [This branch is always up-to-date](https://gitlab.com/university-of-missouri/mizzou-digital/miz-ds/mizzou-design-system/tree/builds).

### Working with the source files

You can compile the Design System with your own assets by downloading our source files and extending it to fit your need. One easy way of doing this is trying out our [Frontend Asset Builder](https://gitlab.missouri.edu/mizzou-digital/miz-ds/theme-frontend). If this fits your needs, let us know and we'll be glad to get you up and running.

🛑 **Before you go on** 🛑

Do you have node.js installed?

- **Yes?** 🤓Continue with the [quick start](#quick-start).
- **No?** Well, you need it. So first, install node before continuing with the quick start. We just so happen to have instructions for [MacOS](https://gitlab.com/university-of-missouri/mizzou-digital/miz-ds/mizzou-design-system/wikis/Mac-environment-setup) and [Windows](https://gitlab.com/university-of-missouri/mizzou-digital/miz-ds/mizzou-design-system/wikis/Windows-environment-setup).

## Quick start

### Framework Development


### Storybook Development

If you are interested in contributing design patterns for the greater Mizzou community, you will need to learn about [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). We use Storybook to develop the [Mizzou Design System documentation](https://designsystem.missouri.edu/).

`yarn storybook` will start the Storybook Development Server. Code changes will automatically trigger rebuilds.
