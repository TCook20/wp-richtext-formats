# @university-of-missouri/stylelint-config

## Summary

This package provides the Mizzou Digital Service `.stylelintrc` as an extensible shared config. If installed properly, developers _should not_ need to set up their own formatters or linters for SCSS or CSS.

### What does it do?

This package provides formatting and linting rules via the stylelint-config for both CSS (`.css`) and Sass (`.scss`).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

A project with either Sass or CSS files or both.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Note: Depending on the project, run either the `npm` or `yarn` commands below. **Do not** run both.

Install the dependencies.

```shell
# Stylelint
npm install --save-dev stylelint stylelint-scss
yarn add --dev stylelint stylelint-scss
```

üõë Make sure you've set up your `.npmrc` file with your deploy token before you install any `@university-of-missouri` packages.

Install our shareable config:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @university-of-missouri/stylelint-config
yarn add --dev @university-of-missouri/stylelint-configprettier-config
```

### üéõ Wiring things up

Add the following lines to your `package.json` file:

```json
// package.json
{
  // ...
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
        "@university-of-missouri/eslint-config"
    ]
  },
  "prettier": "@university-of-missouri/prettier-config"
  // ...
}
```

### üß™ Testing

To make sure everything is working properly, now you can run eslint or prettier on the command line to see if works. Remember to use either `npx` or `yarn` commands depending on which package manager the project uses.

```shell
# Prettier
npx prettier --check path/to/file.js
yarn prettier --check path/to/file.js

# ESLint
npx eslint path/to/file.js
yarn eslint path/to/file.js
```

Replace the `path/to/file.js` portion with a file of your own and run the command. If nothing errors, you'll get nothing back. If there are any warnings or errors you'll see feedback like this:

```shell
# Prettier output
Checking formatting...
[warn] path/to/file.js
[warn] Code style issues found in the above file. Forgot to run Prettier?

# ESLint output
/path/to/file.js
  16:1   warning  Unexpected console statement          no-console
  17:1   warning  Unexpected console statement          no-console
  19:10  error    'isTruthy' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars
  20:3   error    Unexpected 'debugger' statement       no-debugger

‚úñ 4 problems (2 errors, 2 warnings)
```

Neither of these commands should affect the files. It will just check them and let you know everything's working. To clean things up, you'll need to either run the tools normally OR integrate with your IDE (recommended).

## IDE Integration

[VS Code integration](docs/vscode.md) is handled with vetted extensions and a specific `.code-workspace` setup.

If you need an integration other than VS Code, let me know.
